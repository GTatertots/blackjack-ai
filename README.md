# blackjack-ai
A simple Blackjack AI which implements card counting strategies to make optimal bets. This uses the Python Gymnasium library to create an environment that gives feedback to the agent for it to improve upon. There are many AI agents present inside the "Agents" directory, many of which do not do very well. This repository mostly functions as my progression while developing. This was developed as part of an Artificial Intellegence course.
